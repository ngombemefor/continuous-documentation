He is my God. My redemer and my saviour.
I know my redeemer liveths, I know my redeemer liveths, I know my redeemer liveths, he liveths forevermore
He is Lord, He is Lord amen. He has risen from the death and He is Lord, every knee shall bow and every tongue confess that Jesus to tje glory of the Lord
